Download NCBI Taxonomy data and save it to a MySQL database.

The script uses local data (given a directory) or downloads them from NCBI FTP.
The database is re-created from scratch (first dropped, the created) and then
dump files from NCBI are loaded to it.

Database permissions have to be set before using this script.

Files:
ncbi_taxonomy_to_sql.py: main script;
create_tables.sql: demo SQL script that creates database tables;
settings.py.template: a template for settings file.

Depends on python-MySQLdb module.
